# untitled game

This repo contains my entry for [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0). The theme of this game jam is `Aberration`.

# random notes

-   I'm using this game jam not to win, but to learn godot.
-   The engine used will be [Godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/), because I see no point in learning old ass godot3. New is good. I like new.
-   The language used will be GDScript, because ["Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web"](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html).
-   Export target will be Web, because it seems like easy way to make multiplatform game.
-   Seems like default viewport settings on itch.io is 640x360px. Sounds good, I'll hardcode this resolution.
-   It is solo game jam, so the game will be 2D, made in mspaint. It's great that this is solo jam, as I have no friends.

## gameplay

what is the loop, what is there to play, how is it fun

-   a survival game, where player is a beast
-   world is fixed and hand crafted
-   resources (trees/stones) never respawn
-   game is hardcore-like by default, when player dies all his stuff is gone. the game basicly restarts from the moment the beast is born
-   player knowledge (out of game) about static world and events to come is preserved
-   beast knowledge (in game) is also preserved (like crafting recipes)
-   scattered over the map will be boss monsters, unreasonably strong, ment to be defeated only by strategy/traps/cheese. the beast (player) will consume flesh of defeated boss monster triggering a physical/visual change that persists through deaths. boss monster will not respawn when world resets - allowing smart player to use bosses lair as a convenient starter base
-   human related points of interest (a hunter's hut, a campfire, a small village) will contain knowledge/crafting recipes and good materials (leathers, metals, etc)

## connection with theme

what is aberrant, in what way

-   a game being hardcore by default is a deprature from what is normal in gaming
-   loss of progress is definitely unwelcome by players
-   a time loop is an unexpected change in the flow of time
-   the beast (controlled by player) is an abnormal entity, the game will hint that this beast (and the time loop) existed long before player started playing the game. over unknown period of time the beast's sentience slowly changed into sapience. the beast will also become unwelcome and feared by humans, as it is non-human creature that is able to use tools, use strategic thinking, and seemingly knows about future events.
-   as a whole the experience of playing this game will be (by design) abnormal, as the game will have no tutorial, no hints, no menus, and as little ui as possible. as an extra bonus it will strike fear into players heart as there will be no hint if the game is saved. game auto saves. but did it really save? are you sure you can quit now?
-   as player defeats boss monsters and accumulates physical changes - his looks will be more monster-like and less animal-like. initially small critters will mostly ignore player, however after accumulating boss monster features, critters will start scattering in fear. as the game progresses more spiecies will be fearful/hostile by default. by the end player will be unwelcome by his own spiecies.

# todo

-   make README.md normal (this file right now is an aberration of README.md)
-   figure out what is the end goal of the game? or is it sandbox game with no end?
