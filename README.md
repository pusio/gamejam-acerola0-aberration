# untitled game

This repo contains my entry for [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0). The theme of this game jam is `Aberration`.

# random notes

-   I'm using this game jam not to win, but to learn godot.
-   The engine used will be [Godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/), because I see no point in learning old ass godot3. New is good. I like new.
-   The language used will be GDScript, because ["Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web"](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html).
-   Export target will be Web, because it seems like easy way to make multiplatform game.
-   Seems like default viewport settings on itch.io is 640x360px. Sounds good, I'll hardcode this resolution.
-   It is solo game jam, so the game will be 2D, made in mspaint. It's great that this is solo jam, as I have no friends.

# todo

-   make README.md normal (this file right now is an aberration of README.md)
-   figure out idea for the game, gameplay loop, how is it abberant
