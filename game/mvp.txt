tips for players:
you should try to figure out stuff yourself, but if the game seems too hard please read the tips below:
- look at beast's eyes to guess how healthy it is
- bigger beasts have more health and deal more damage
- eating food helps you grow and heal over time
- berries give less saturation than fruits, meat gives the most
- body size of slain beast decides how much meat will drop
- while nearby beasts will try to steal your fruits and berries, they never eat meat of their own spiecies
- ocelots are least hostile towards you and will not agro unless attacked
- if you are hurt try to run away
- enemies may heal if left alone too long, however they only heal if well fed
- the goal is to find and defeat four beast kings during a single life
- killing a beast king will grant you a magical buff that persist through death
- boar king takes less damage than usual boar. defeating him will reduce your damage taken.
- spider king is faster than other spiders. defeating him will decrease your attack cooldown.
- snake king always regenerates life (even when hungry). defeating him will allow you to get more saturation from any food eaten.
- ocelot king is bigger than other beasts. defeating him will increase your growth speed and max growth size.
